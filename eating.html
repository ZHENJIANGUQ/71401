        <h1 class="he-header-title">Benefits of Healthy Eating</h1>
        <p class="he-header-description">Following a healthy diet has many benefits, including building strong bones, protecting the heart, preventing disease, and boosting mood.</p>

        <h2 class="he-title">Heart Health</h2>
        <p class="he-description">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States.</p>
        <p class="he-description">The American Heart Association (AHA) states that almost half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease.</p>
        <p class="he-description">High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a growing concern in the U.S. The condition can lead to a heart attack, heart failure, and a stroke.</p>
        <p class="he-description">It may be possible to prevent up to 80% of premature heart disease and stroke diagnoses with lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and healthful eating.</p>

        <h3 class="he-sub-title">DASH Diet Recommendations</h3>
        <ul class="he-list">
            <li>Eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains</li>
            <li>Choosing fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils</li>
            <li>Limiting saturated and trans fat intake, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products</li>
            <li>Limiting drinks and foods that contain added sugars</li>
            <li>Restricting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day — ideally 1,500 mg daily</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="he-description">High-fiber foods are also crucial for keeping the heart healthy. The AHA states that dietary fiber helps improve blood cholesterol and lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p class="he-description">The medical community has long recognized the link between trans fats and heart-related illnesses, such as coronary heart disease.</p>

        <h3 class="he-sub-title">Reducing Blood Pressure</h3>
        <p class="he-description">Reducing blood pressure can also promote heart health. Most adults may achieve this by limiting their salt intake to no more than 1,500 mg per day.</p>
        <p class="he-description">Food manufacturers add salt to many processed and fast foods, and a person who wishes to lower their blood pressure should avoid these products.</p>
