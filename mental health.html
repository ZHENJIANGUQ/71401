        <h1 class="mh-title-unique">Mental Health Awareness</h1>
    
        <p class="mh-important-info-unique"><strong>Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the US. 1 in 5 Americans will experience a mental illness each year.</strong></p>
    
        <h2 class="mh-subtitle-unique">What is Mental Health?</h2>
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">Mental health includes our psychological, emotional, and social well-being. It affects how we act as well as think and feel. It also helps determine how we handle everyday stress, interact with our peers, and make decisions. Mental health is important from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
    
        <h2 class="mh-subtitle-unique">What Causes Mental Illness?</h2>
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">There is no single known cause of mental illness. In most cases, several factors contribute, such as:</p>
        <ul class="mh-list-unique">
            <li>Early trauma or adverse life experiences</li>
            <li>Experiences related to other chronic medical conditions such as cancer or diabetes</li>
            <li>Chemical imbalances or biological factors</li>
            <li>Feelings of isolation, loneliness</li>
            <li>Addictions such as drug or alcohol abuse</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="mh-subtitle-unique">What to do in a Mental Health Crisis</h2>
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">While 9-1-1 is currently used for all types of emergencies, 9-8-8 is specifically available for mental health crises. 9-1-1 dispatchers are not trained in how to handle mental health or suicide-related calls, but 9-8-8 calls are handled by National Suicide Prevention Lifeline counselors. Calling 9-8-8 can also connect you to additional local resources as needed.</p>
    
        <div class="mh-call-to-action-unique">
            <p>At Holy Cross Health, we care about all of you – including your emotional and mental health. Please know mental health conditions are treatable, and we can help.</p>
            <p>If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions, we encourage you to reach out to us.</p>
            <p>Call your doctor today, or schedule an appointment online, to discuss your concerns. If your situation is urgent/emergent, please call 9-8-8.</p>
        </div>
    
        <h2 class="mh-subtitle-unique">Support for Caregivers</h2>
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">Caring for a loved one with a mental illness can be challenging. Here are some resources for families in this situation:</p>
        <ul class="mh-list-unique">
            <li><strong>National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):</strong> NAMI offers resources and support for families and caregivers of individuals with mental illness. They have local chapters throughout the United States and offer free educational programs, support groups, and advocacy services.</li>
            <li><strong>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):</strong> SAMHSA offers resources and information for families and caregivers of individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders. They provide information on treatment options, support services, and how to find local resources.</li>
            <li><strong>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH):</strong> NIMH offers information and resources for families and caregivers of individuals with mental illness. They provide information on different mental illnesses, treatment options, and research updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">It's important for caregivers to prioritize their own mental health and well-being as well, these resources also offer tips and strategies for self-care.</p>
    
        <p class="mh-paragraph-unique">Holy Cross Health remains committed to being a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities – it is the core of our mission and centered on your health and well-being.</p>
